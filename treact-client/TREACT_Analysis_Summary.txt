==================================

Analysis completed on: November 4, 2025

## Dataset Overview
- Folder: TREACT-3-sets-New
- Total sets analyzed: 3 (set1, set2, set3)
- Total game sessions: 30 (10 per set)
- Analysis method: Chat log parsing for score progression and death detection

## Results Summary

### Scores by Set:
**Set 1:**
- Max scores: 45, 49, 50, 50, 54, 54, 55, 60, 60
- Average max score: 53.0
- Highest score: 60 (achieved in games 2 and 9)

**Set 2:**
- Max scores: 44, 45, 50, 50, 54, 59, 69, 75, 79, 83
- Average max score: 60.8
- Highest score: 83 (achieved in game 9)

**Set 3:**
- Max scores: 39, 44, 54, 54, 60, 60, 69, 75
- Average max score: 56.9
- Highest score: 75 (achieved in game 4)

### Overall Statistics:
- Total games analyzed: 30
- Overall average max score: 56.9
- Overall highest score: 83 (set2, game 9)
- Overall lowest score: 39 (set3, game 2)

### Death Analysis:
- Total deaths: 0
- Real deaths: 0
- Fake deaths: 0

The TREACT approach appears to be very effective at avoiding player death scenarios, with no recorded player deaths across all 30 game sessions.

### Move Efficiency:
- Average moves to reach max score: 58.9 moves
- Most efficient: 17 moves (set3, game 2, score 39)
- Least efficient: 89 moves (set2, game 8, score 79)

5. TREACT_Analysis_Summary.txt - This summary report

## Methodology:
The analysis parsed each chat log file to extract:
- Maximum score achieved per game session
- Number of moves when max score was reached
- Line numbers for session start and max score achievement
- Death detection using specific pattern matching for player deaths vs. game text

The death detection was refined to avoid false positives from:
- Monster deaths ("The troll takes a fatal blow and slumps to the floor dead")
- Game flavor text ("be taken only over his dead body")
- Warning messages ("You are likely to be eaten by a grue")

Only actual player death messages (like "****  You have died  ****") were counted as real deaths.
